## About 

Tiger-games is the application that we build in [DeveloperWay](https://www.developerway.it/). 

## Running the project

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) if you haven't already.
2. Copy the `.env` template file and set the enviroment variables both for server and client.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

```bash
cd client && cp .env.template .env
```

4. Install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn && cd client && yarn
```

<!-- You can visit the app by going to `http://localhost:3000`. -->

### Demo 

[You can visit the site here](https://github.com/DeveloperWayIT/group-2).

> `Note`: It's currently deployed on free tier Heroku, which has some undesirable side-effects like shutting off the server during periods of inactivity. So if it's down for you, refresh a couple of times. Thinking about migrating this to a serverless architecture later on.
